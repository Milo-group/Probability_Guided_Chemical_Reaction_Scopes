This folder contains the following subfolders:
  
**Comparison of different model performances**  
Performance comparison of different models, including kNN, SVM, NN, and RF.  
  
**Convex hull for rubostness**
Contains R code for checking the convex hull of the training and test sets, as well as for external validation and predictions.  
  
**Extreme Values**  
Analysis evaluating the model’s performance on extreme data points.  
  
**Random sampling**  
Sampling of training and test sets performed randomly instead of using similarity-based under-sampling.
