This folder contains the following subfolders:
  
**Data**  
All relevant ```*.csv``` files used for modeling and two ```*.R``` files for reproducing the models and performing cross-validation.  
  
**Model reports**  
PDF files containing various model reports, with and without ordinal implementation, and with and without similarity under-sampling.  
  
**Model validation and comparative analysis**  
This folder contains materials for validating and comparing model performances, including analyses of different models (kNN, SVM, NN, RF), robustness checks using convex hull methods, evaluations on extreme values, and experiments with random sampling approaches.  
  
**Psy-Chem**  
Data related to the expert survey conducted to determine whether classification is necessary.  
  
**XYZ structures**  
XYZ structures of data used in this study.  
  
Below is an example of how to model the data (the corresponding ```*.R``` file is provided in the Data folder):  
  
```r
library(rxn.cond.class)

# Load data from a CSV file into a data frame
data <- data.frame(data.table::fread('Training_Data.csv'), check.names = F)

# Clean and organize data
row.names(data) <- data[,2]  # Set the second column as row names
data$class <- as.factor(data$class)  # Convert the 'class' column to a factor
data <- data[,-c(1:2)]  # Remove the first and second columns (name and tag)

# Similarity-based sampling for each class
one <- simi.sampler(data, 1)  # Sample from class 1
two <- simi.sampler(data, 2)  # Sample from class 2
three <- simi.sampler(data, 3)  # Sample from class 3

# Sample class 1 molecules similar to class 3
one_three <- simi.sampler(data, 1, 3)  

# Sample class 2 molecules similar to class 3
two_three <- simi.sampler(data, 2, 3)  

# Combine the similarities from the various classes into one vector
similarties <- c(union(one, one_three), 
                 union(two, two_three), 
                 three)

# Train ordinal models using the subset of data corresponding to similarities
models.ordinal <- sub_model_log(data = data[similarties, ], 
                                min = 4, 
                                max = 4, 
                                ordinal = T)


# Define the training set from the subset of similarities
Train.data <- data[similarties, ]

# Define the test set from the remaining rows not in the similarities set
Test.data <- data[-similarties, ]
```
