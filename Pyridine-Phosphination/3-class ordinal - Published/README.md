This folder contains the following subfolders:
  
**Data**  
All relevant ```*.csv``` files used for modeling and two ```*.R``` files for reproducing the models and performing cross-validation.  
  
**Model reports**  
PDF files containing model reports for the three-category classification and the analysis of the best model’s features.  
  
**XYZ structures**  
XYZ structures of data used in this study.  

This folder also contains a ```*.csv``` file:  
  
**Molecule_smiles**  
This file contains the SMILES representations of all relevant molecules.   
  
Below is an example of how to model the data (the corresponding ```*.R``` file is provided in the **Data** subfolder):  
  
```r
library(rxn.cond.class)

# Import training data from a CSV file
data_bin <- data.frame(data.table::fread("Training_Data_rdkit_stereoelectronic.csv")) 

# Set the first column as row names
row.names(data_bin) <- data_bin[,1]  
data_bin <- data_bin[,-1]  # Remove the first column after setting row names

# Convert the 'class' column to a factor
data_bin$class <- as.factor(data_bin$class)  

# Convert the first 50 columns to numeric values
data_bin[,c(1:50)] <- as.numeric(as.matrix(data_bin[,c(1:50)]))  

# Convert columns 51 to 64 to factors after converting to numeric
for (i in 51:64) data_bin[,i] <- as.factor(as.numeric(data_bin[,i]))

# Add a 'flag' column to sequentially number the rows
data_bin <- plyr::mutate(data_bin, flag = seq(1,nrow(data_bin)))

# Sample from group 1 using simi.sampler
one <- simi.sampler(data_bin, 1)

# Sample 21 molecules from group 2
two <- simi.sampler(data_bin, 2, sample.size = 21)

# Sample from group 3 using simi.sampler
three <- simi.sampler(data_bin, 3)

# Combine the similarities from groups 1, 2, and 3 into one vector
uni_similarties <- c(one, 
                     two, 
                     three)

# Train models on the subset of data corresponding to the combined similarities
models <- sub_model_log(data = data_bin[uni_similarties, ], 
                        min = 3, 
                        max = 3, 
                        ordinal = T)

# Present the list of models in a table format
knitr::kable(models)

# Define training data from the subset of similarities
Train.data <- data_bin[uni_similarties, ]

# Define test data from the remaining rows not in the similarities set
Test.data <- data_bin[-uni_similarties, ]
```
